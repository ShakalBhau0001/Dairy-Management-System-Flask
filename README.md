# 🐄 Dairy Management System — Flask

**Dairy Management System** is a **modern full-stack web application** built with **Python, Flask, and MySQL**, designed to streamline dairy business operations with a clean and intuitive web interface.

The system supports **secure Admin authentication**, allowing administrators to manage customers, record daily milk collection (Morning & Evening), maintain fat/SNF-based pricing rate charts, and monitor all dairy operations efficiently through a structured web dashboard.

This project demonstrates **Flask web development, MySQL database integration, modular Blueprint architecture, session-based authentication, and real-world CRUD workflows**, making it ideal for academic mini-projects and portfolio showcases.

## ✨ Key Principles

1. **Secure Admin Access** – Session-based login with protected routes
2. **Customer Management** – Add, view, and manage dairy customers with unique codes
3. **Milk Collection Tracking** – Morning & Evening shift collection with fat/SNF records
4. **Rate Chart System** – Fat and SNF based dynamic pricing management
5. **Modular Architecture** – Clean Blueprint-based Flask structure with `.env` config

> This system is both **practical and educational**, demonstrating how real-world dairy management systems are built using Python and Flask.

## 🧩 System Overview

The application is built around a secure admin panel with four core modules:

### 👨‍💼 Admin
- Secure login with session management
- All routes are protected — unauthenticated users redirected to login
- Full control over all dairy operations

### 👥 Customer Management
- Add new dairy customers with unique customer codes
- Support for Cow 🐄 and Buffalo 🐃 milk types
- Customer status: Active (`ON`) / Inactive (`OFF`)
- View all registered customer records

### 🥛 Milk Collection
- Record daily milk collection — Morning & Evening shifts
- Capture Liters, Fat %, SNF %, Rate, and Total amount
- View complete collection history

### 📊 Rate Chart
- Add fat/SNF based milk pricing rates
- Separate rates for Cow and Buffalo milk
- View current and historical rate charts

---

## 🔗 Core Workflow

- Admin logs in securely
